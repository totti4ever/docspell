# Changelog

## v0.4.0 

*unknown*

- Support for archive files. Archives are files that contain other
  files, like zip files. Docspell now extracts archives and adds the
  content to an item. The extraction process is recursive, so there
  may be zip files in zip files. File types supported:
  - `zip` every file inside is added to one item as attachment
  - `eml` (RCF822 E-Mail files) E-mails are considered archives, since
    they may contain multiple files (body and attachments).
- Periodic Tasks framework: Docspell can now run tasks periodically
  based on a schedule. This is not yet exposed to the user, but there
  are some system cleanup jobs to start with. 
- Improvement of the text analysis. For my test files there was a
  increase in accuracy by about 10%.

## v0.3.0

*Mar. 1, 2020*

- Support for many more document types has been added (including
  images and office documents). All input files are converted into PDF
  files (the original file is preserved).
- PDF Text extraction improved by omitting OCR if text can be
  stripped.
- There is a new PDF viewer (utilizing viewerjs) that also works in
  mobile browsers.
- Improve editing notes: Since notes may evolve, there is now a larger
  edit form and a markdown preview.
- Show the extracted information (text, labels, proposals) of an
  attachment in the Webui.
- The name search now also searches in item notes.
- Bug fixed where it was possible to create invalid input when
  creating new sources.
- Bug fixed where the item menu was not properly initialized for
  equipments.
- The `ds.sh` script has now an option to check a file for existence
  in docspell.
