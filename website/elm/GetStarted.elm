            """1. Clone the github repository
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/eikek/docspell
   ```
   Alternatively, [download](https://github.com/eikek/docspell/archive/master.zip) the sources and extract the zip file.
2. Change into the `docker` directory:
   ```bash
   $ cd docspell/docker/docker-compose
   ```
3. Run `docker-compose up`:

   ```bash
   $ export DOCSPELL_HEADER_VALUE="my-secret-123"
   $ docker-compose up
   ```

   The environment variable defines a secret that is shared between
   some containers. You can define whatever you like. Please see the
   [`consumedir.sh`](doc/tools/consumedir#docker) docs for additional
   info.
4. Goto <http://localhost:7880>, signup and login. When signing up,
   choose the same name for collective and user. Then login
   with this name and the password.

5. (Optional) Create a folder `./docs/<collective-name>` (the name you
   chose for the collective at registration) and place files in there
   for importing them.

The directory contains a file `docspell.conf` that you can
[modify](docs/configure) as needed.
